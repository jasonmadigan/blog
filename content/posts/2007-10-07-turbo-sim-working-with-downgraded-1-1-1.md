title: Turbo SIM working with downgraded 1.1.1

I was pretty sure this would be possible, but reports about this working
out there are sketchy at best so I wanted to put it to the test. Since I
now have a test iPhone to break before selling it on, I upgraded it to
1.1.1 to dump the filesystem over the past few days. I also got to test
to see if the upgraded modem baseband firmware would still work with a
TurboSIM. To test, I downgraded from 1.1.1 to 1.02 - the modem firmware
obviously remains intact from 1.1.1. Everything works as before with
baseband version 03.14.08\_G. I was half expecting to maybe run into
some issues with Applesaft, as 04.01.13\_G reads the AT&T IMSI three
times as opposed to one, but all seems fine.
