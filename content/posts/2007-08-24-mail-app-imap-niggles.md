title: Mail.app - IMAP Niggles

I'd always used one single email account and tried, wherever possible,
to keep these accounts completely separate from one another. At work I
now find myself using two IMAP accounts, one for work and one personal
account. Setting the accounts up is a doddle, but I noticed that
messages I was sending from my work account where not getting stored in
my mailbox.

After some fiddling I found that to have messages sent from one account
stored in the sent mailbox for that account, you need to explicitly tell
Mail.app what each of the server-side folders are to be used for. To
specify this, click on them and go to Mailbox \>Use this mailbox for \>
Sent/Drafts/Trash. I just thought I'd share in case anyone else comes up
against this problem.
