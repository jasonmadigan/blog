It's an exciting time for JavaScript developers. Over the past few
months, we've seen all sorts of cool things coming our way. We've seen
new fast, heavily optimised JavaScript virtual machines such as
WebKit's[SquirrelFish](http://webkit.org/blog/189/announcing-squirrelfish/),
Mozilla's [TraceMonkey](https://wiki.mozilla.org/JavaScript:TraceMonkey)
and, most recently, Google's [V8](http://code.google.com/p/v8/). We've
seen all kinds of cool things done with these new VMs, perhaps the
coolest (to my mind) is running dynamic languages such as Ruby in the
browser - see
[here](http://macournoyer.wordpress.com/2008/09/02/ruby-on-v8/).

We've also seen the effective death of the ECMAScript 4 proposal and
seen it reborn as ECMAScript Harmony. To top things off, we've also seen
some very interesting new JavaScript frameworks designed specifically
with complex client-side web applications such as
[SproutCore](http://www.sproutcore.com/) and, just today, [Cappccino &
Objective-J](http://cappuccino.org/). The web development world is
evolving too quickly for the current model of standards adoption remain
sustainable, and it's nice to see that developers like those behind
Cappuccino get it.
