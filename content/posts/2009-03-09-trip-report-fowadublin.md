I attended FOWA Dublin Friday last, and had a pretty good time. The
speakers were the main reason I attended, with DHH & Simon Willison
delivering particularly great talks. There were a couple of things that
bugged me about the event setup. Not to be a jerk or anything, but
there's a few points I hope the
[Carsonified](http://www.carsonified.com/fowa/) guys take a look at and
fix in time for next year:

-   Poor WiFi - I know the guys have apologised about this already, but
    it stuck in most people's craw and I guess it bears repeating. With
    400 odd people milling about with iPhones and Macs some decent WiFi
    would've been nice.
-   Socialising is kind of hard when you've got absolutely no room to
    move.
-   I don't really care about toilets, but I heard there was only one
    bathroom for guys and one for girls.
-   Lack of freebies. The tickets were pretty pricey (although I'd guess
    individuals paying for their own tickets were in the minority).
    Basically the only thing given away was a name-tag & holder. Free
    coffee for breaks or something would've gone down nicely.
