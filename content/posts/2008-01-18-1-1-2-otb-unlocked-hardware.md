Some semi-good news for poor sods with 1.1.2 out of the box iPhones
reached my eyes & ears this morning - 1.1.2 iPhones with the v4.6
bootloader can now have their bootloader downgraded to 3.9 and then
unlocked. Unfortunately this remains a hardware testpoint method for the
time being. If you're brave and fearless you can follow geohot's guide
to doing this

A 1.1.3 jailbreak still seems to be a ways off, with the good old
symbolic link method seemingly neutered.
