Finally. Restoring an iPhone is no longer quite so painful. No more
jumping through hoops downgrading to 1.1.1 and slowly clawing your way
back up to 1.1.3 with all manner of ridiculous soft updates. Thanks to
Zibree's
[ZiPhone](http://zibree.blogspot.com/2008/02/ziphone-updated.html), you
no longer need to beg and plead with your iPhone to play along with you
for two hours to get your iPhone back in working order. Unlocking,
activating & jailbreaking any iPhone is now incredibly simple and fast.

Somebody really had to do this - when 1.1.4 lands (and it will soon),
restoring an iPhone would have previously meant no less than 4 jailbreak
hoops to jump through.
