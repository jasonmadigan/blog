This is the first Apple product I've owned that's died. The hard drive seems to be fine though. Plugged it into another machine and it works just fine. I guess all that heat killed the logicboard. I guess it had been warning me with a few months though - its DHCP server had become very flakey over the past few weeks.

Oh well, time to dust off my old dependable WRT54GL.
