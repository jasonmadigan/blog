I never thought I'd actually have any use for a blog (and to be honest
I'd always found myself struggling to see why other people needed them
too), but I guess what with working on new projects and having finally
completed college I could do with some place to organise my ramblings,
so here we are.

I'd been meaning to put together an online portfolio with quite some
time now, so I guess now is as good a time as any.
