We knew this would happen weeks ago. Most of us knew that the iPhone was
going to be locked down for third party applications as well as SIM
unlocks. It isn't possible (currently) to jailbreak an iPod touch and
the same can now be said of any iPhone running 1.1.1. iTunes no longer
communicates **with** the iPhone, instead iTunes listens for commands
sent *from* the iPhone. This means listening for keys is no longer
possible, which means decrypting ramdisks is also no longer possible.
The whole thing is a tremendous pain in the ass but absolutely nobody
can say this wasn't expected. Just deal with it and accept it; we all
knew what we were getting ourselves in for.

Incidentally, if you do need to restore your iPhone, download this:

[iPhone1,1\_1.0.2\_1C28\_Restore.ipsw](http://content.info.apple.com/iPhone/061-3823.20070821.vormd/iPhone1,1_1.0.2_1C28_Restore.ipsw)

And alt-click the restore button in iTunes. You'll be able to choose the
firmware you wish to restore using.
