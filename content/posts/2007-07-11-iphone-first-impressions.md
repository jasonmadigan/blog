At work today I finally got my hands on an iPhone. It was everything I'd
hoped for. Beautiful design, much smaller than I'd imagined and pretty
sturdy. I played around with viewing a movie, playing with the camera
and generally poking about the parts of the phone which didn't require
the GSM radio. I want one. I mean, I wanted one before but without
having held and used one it's very easy to dismiss purchasing it by
saying to yourself "Oh, I'll wait, you know firsthand what first gen
Apple hardware is like" or "But, but 3G!". I'm very tempted to take the
plunge and import one in the hope that the radio will get unlocked quite
soon.
