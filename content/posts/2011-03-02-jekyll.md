Way back in November, 2008, I read an [article](http://tom.preston-werner.com/2008/11/17/blogging-like-a-hacker.html) by Tom Preston-Werner which detailed his approach to blogging and blogging software. For years I've been trying to use one terrible CMS or another. The idea of sitting down to write *yet another* CMS to tackle some of the issues I have with blogging software really didn't appeal to me. Remembering his article, I started poking with [Jekyll](http://github.com/mojombo/jekyll). I had a pretty good idea of what I wanted:

-   Simplicity
-   CLI-based editing
-   Posts in a plaintext format, with formatting in a really lightweight
    markup language like
    [Textile](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Textile_%28markup_language%29)
-   Static content generation - if you post something popular, chances
    are you're going to start flushing "dynamic" content out to disk as
    static HTML. Why bother waiting to write posts out as static files?
-   No comments â€” as far as I'm concerned, the effort required to manage
    spam and user comments simply isn't worth it.
