I was bored three weekends ago and had an idea for a simple Irish weather app. Met Eireann have tons of great data available to the public, but finding the good stuff was a little fiddly. Anyway, after a weekend of work in Photoshop and Xcode, I had a pretty nice app. It was finally approved late last night. It's free to download, so feel free to give it a spin.
