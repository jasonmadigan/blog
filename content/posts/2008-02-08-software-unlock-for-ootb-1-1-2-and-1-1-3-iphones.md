title: Software Unlock for OOTB 1.1.2 & 1.1.3 iPhones

Mister George Hotz has come through for us once again, with a [software
based
unlock](http://iphonejtag.blogspot.com/2008/02/11246unlock-good-enough-for-prize.html)
for out of the box 1.1.2 & 1.1.3 iPhones. Now would be a good time to
buy one. It uses a delightful IPSF based method but this one doesn't
zero out your seczones. So should Apple lose their minds in the future
and include a bootloader update in a future software release you won't
end up with a complete brick.

It seems Zibri got tired of the two dev teams'
shenanigans once more and decided to jump the gun and
[release](http://code.google.com/p/iphone-elite/wiki/JerrySim) the
method used by an upcoming semi-hardware unlock (an exploit piggybacking
on a Turbo SIM, once run there's no need for the Turbo SIM anymore), the
details of which have been known by the dev-team for several weeks now.

Interesting times. Of course this means I'm going to be bombarded with a
stream of requests for unlocking - all of which I'm going to politely
decline. The iPhone is great and all, but eventually you come to realise
that, with every new firmware release, the time it'll take you to
restore should something terrible happen is going to increase
considerably. I don't know about you guys, but as soon as an official
release is confirmed for here with 3G, I'm jumping ship. It's just too
tiring.
