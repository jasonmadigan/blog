title: iPhone - Voicemail Notification

I've noticed some weird issues regarding certain kinds of SMS messages
not being delivered properly to my iPhone. Specifically, voicemail alert
alerts sent by SMS never land in my inbox at all. After doing a little
digging, it seems that the iPhone's baseband has trouble interpreting
incoming SMS messages coming from [short
codes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Short_code).

Since short codes are used quite a bit in Europe for promotions, banking
and the like I should think that the firmware shipping on European
iPhone's will have fixed this. In the meantime we'll have to keep
digging to try to find a workaround.
