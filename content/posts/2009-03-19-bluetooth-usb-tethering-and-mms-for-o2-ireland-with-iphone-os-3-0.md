title: Bluetooth/USB tethering & MMS for O2 Ireland with iPhone OS 3.0

**Update \#2: These carrier settings will work with Beta 2 also. Also,
Safari likes to attach a .zip extension to the ipcc, so either rename
the downloaded file minus the extension or use Firefox/curl something
else to download the updated carrier settings.**

**Update: Updated the MMS proxy settings, the previous version was using
an old proxy. To update just re-download the carrier settings and apply
an update once more.**

After a little dicking around prompted by some stuff I noticed on
twitter, I cobbled together this updated carrier bundle for O2 Ireland
to enable USB/Bluetooth tethering for iPhone OS 3.0. This also enables
the sending/recieving of MMS messages a new photo button will appear in
Messages.app to send pictures as MMS messages.

Grab it [here](http://www.jasonmadigan.com/O2_ie.ipcc).

To install, option (alt) click update in iTunes, and select this updated
IPCC.

If something terrible happens, you can grab a backup of the old one to
restore [here](http://www.jasonmadigan.com/O2_ie.ipcc.backup).
