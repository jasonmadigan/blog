Geohot initally thought the JTAG interface may have been been located in the dock, but his search proved fruitless. Accessing these traces is incredibly difficult because the board has many layers and blind via&amp;rsquo;s, and in the end could only be done by removing the S-Gold 2 from the baseband board altogether, which meant wrecking the board.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
