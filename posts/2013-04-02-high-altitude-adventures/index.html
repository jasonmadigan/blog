I looked at it and thought it seemed like a good use of time. I got talking to <a href=http://blog.danielvagg.com/blog/>a friend of mine</a> at work about the possibilites of launching something like this from Ireland. As it turned out, some people from launched successfully from Kerry <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cqGoFAts1ag">a few years back</a>.</p><p>My initial plan was to launch something simple: a helium filled 800g balloon with some kind of cheap Android phone taking snaps every now and then. After watching lots of YouTube footage, and lots scouring through resources such the <a href=http://ukhas.org.uk/>UK High Altitude Society</a>, our plans evolved. Dan was keen for a more elaborate payload (it involves a fixed wing glider, some servos and a death spiral - I&rsquo;m sure he&rsquo;ll tell you all about it). Eventually we settled on the idea of sending two payloads on one flight.</p><h2 id=initial-questions>Initial Questions</h2><p>One of the first things that I wanted answering was whether or not it was actually legal to launch a high altitude balloon in Irish airspace. <del>As it turns out, the IAA have a pretty comprehensive document on the subject <a href="https://www.iaa.ie/library_download.jsp?libraryID=213">here</a>. I&rsquo;ve yet to receive permission to launch from them, but I am hopeful.</del></p><p><em>Update:</em> the IAA were very firm in giving a &ldquo;No&rdquo; to any such launch. Apparently they&rsquo;ve only ever given permission for such launches to Met Éireann. Disappointing, but the CAA in the UK granted me permission to launch in Northern Ireland and were far more helpful.</p><h2 id=problems>Problems</h2><p>In the first few days, with some whiteboarding during lunches and late night conversations, we came up against some issues.</p><ul><li><p>Initially, Android devices looked like a good idea for simple flight computers. We had some ideas to develop some <a href=http://www.feedhenry.com>FeedHenry</a> powered Apps to record and relay basic telemetry to a Node.js app - we&rsquo;d use WebSockets to pipe data back in realtime. Knowing how flakey your average cellular data network is, I had my doubts this would work. A bigger problem, though, was that GSM was unlikely to work at anywhere near the altitudes we were interested in.</p></li><li><p>We largely started out with no idea of how much this was likely to cost. Our guestimates of maybe €200 each were blown in the first week of parts acquisition (for me at least).</p></li></ul><h2 id=lifting-gas>Lifting Gas</h2><p>Helium looked like the best lifting gas, since it was inert and it&rsquo;s relatively cheap. Or it was - this isn&rsquo;t the case anymore. Poking around, we found many places offering balloon helium for party balloons. This, as it turned out, wasn&rsquo;t good enough for our purposes. Your average party balloon gas is only about 30% helium - the rest is usually air. We&rsquo;d heard some estimates from others that 9cubic meters of industrial helium from BOC costs about €600 (including tank rental) - which is pretty extraordinary.</p></div><div class=post-footer></div></article></main></body></html>
