I&rsquo;d planned to do for 2 or 3 years; give
<a href=http://www.autosystems.ie/>autosystems.ie</a> a complete
rewrite/redesign. At the moment the homepage is a mess of static content
and things don&rsquo;t get much better when we look at the shopping cart
system. The shopping cart as it stands right now is a pretty hacked up
version of <a href=http://www.oscommerce.com/>OSCommerce</a> which has been
slowly disintegrating over the past year. No less than 4 times in the
past year I&rsquo;ve had a call from my brother where it had broken
unexpectedly, seemingly without any user interaction whatsoever.</p><p>So I decided to set about developing a really simple shopping cart
system which would be a snap to maintain and which my brother would find
easy to use. I also needed to implement a really lightweight CMS so that
he could change some page elements on the homepage informing people of
new offers and the like. 4 hours later and I&rsquo;ve got a pretty nifty Ajax
shopping cart system working. There&rsquo;s still quite a bit to do (payment
functionality with PayPal/Authorize.net for one) but on the whole I&rsquo;m
amazed at how quickly it came together. Well, maybe not that amazed, I
have been using it to develop Runt over the past few months.</p></div><div class=post-footer></div></article></main></body></html>
