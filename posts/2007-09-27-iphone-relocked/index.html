going to be locked down for third party applications as well as SIM
unlocks. It isn&rsquo;t possible (currently) to jailbreak an iPod touch and
the same can now be said of any iPhone running 1.1.1. iTunes no longer

The whole thing is a tremendous pain in the ass but absolutely nobody
can say this wasn&rsquo;t expected. Just deal with it and accept it; we all
knew what we were getting ourselves in for.</p><p>Incidentally, if you do need to restore your iPhone, download this:</p><p><a href=http://content.info.apple.com/iPhone/061-3823.20070821.vormd/iPhone1,1_1.0.2_1C28_Restore.ipsw>iPhone1,1_1.0.2_1C28_Restore.ipsw</a></p><p>And alt-click the restore button in iTunes. You&rsquo;ll be able to choose the
firmware you wish to restore using.</p></div><div class=post-footer></div></article></main></body></html>
