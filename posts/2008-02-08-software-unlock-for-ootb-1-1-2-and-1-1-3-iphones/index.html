based
unlock</a>
for out of the box 1.1.2 & 1.1.3 iPhones. Now would be a good time to
buy one. It uses a delightful IPSF based method but this one doesn&rsquo;t
zero out your seczones. So should Apple lose their minds in the future
and include a bootloader update in a future software release you won&rsquo;t
end up with a complete brick.</p><p>It seems Zibri got tired of the two dev teams'
shenanigans once more and decided to jump the gun and
<a href=http://code.google.com/p/iphone-elite/wiki/JerrySim>release</a> the
method used by an upcoming semi-hardware unlock (an exploit piggybacking
on a Turbo SIM, once run there&rsquo;s no need for the Turbo SIM anymore), the
details of which have been known by the dev-team for several weeks now.</p><p>Interesting times. Of course this means I&rsquo;m going to be bombarded with a
stream of requests for unlocking - all of which I&rsquo;m going to politely
decline. The iPhone is great and all, but eventually you come to realise
that, with every new firmware release, the time it&rsquo;ll take you to
restore should something terrible happen is going to increase
considerably. I don&rsquo;t know about you guys, but as soon as an official
release is confirmed for here with 3G, I&rsquo;m jumping ship. It&rsquo;s just too
tiring.</p></div><div class=post-footer></div></article></main></body></html>
